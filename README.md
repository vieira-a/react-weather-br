# Weather Forecast API
## About

API weather forecast to brazilian capitals.
This project is based on this [Front-end Challege](https://github.com/1STi/desafio-frontend/).
## How it works

 The app queries address https://api.hgbrasil.com/weather using the city's code param. 
 The API returns data JSON file with the weather forecast to informed cities.

 You will see a list of Brazilian capitals, and you can select a city to view details about the weather forecast: current information and forecasts for the next 5 days.
